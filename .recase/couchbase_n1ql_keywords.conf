-- List of keywords to re-case Couchbase N1QL keywords

-- used by n1qlcase.pl / couchbase_n1qlcase.pl

-- written in the background while sitting in N1QL workshop @ Couchbase office

-- Regex one per line of keywords to re-case by literal replacement
-- whitespace is converted to \s+ for matching so this list can look cleaner
-- leading/trailing whitespace is automatically trimmed
-- don't specify functions such as COUNT() with brackets since brackets are added as one of several possible keyword boundaries
