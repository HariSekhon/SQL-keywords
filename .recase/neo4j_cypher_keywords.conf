# List of keywords to uppercase for Neo4J Cypher

# Regex one per line of keywords / phrases to uppercase - used by neo4j_uppercase_keywords.pl
# whitespace is converted to \s+ for matching so this list can look cleaner
# leading/trailing whitespace is automatically trimmed
# don't include brackets since brackets are added as one of several possible keyword boundaries
