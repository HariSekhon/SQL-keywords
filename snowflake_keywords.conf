-- List of regex keywords to uppercase for Snowflake SQL

-- Keywords one per line will be replaced as-is with the case specified in here
-- whitespace is converted to \s+ for matching so this list can look cleaner
-- leading/trailing whitespace is automatically trimmed
-- don't specify functions such as COUNT() with brackets since brackets are added as one of several possible keyword boundaries
