-- Mainly based on Hive QL and Impala SQL with some MySQL, Cassandra CQL

-- Regex one per line of keywords to uppercase - used by uppercase_sql_keywords.pl
-- whitespace is converted to \s+ for matching so this list can look cleaner
-- leading/trailing whitespace is automatically trimmed
-- don't specify functions such as COUNT() with brackets since brackets are added as one of several possible keyword boundaries
